   Product Vision
	 We want to create an app that allows people to keep track of their grocery inventory. So that all kinds of people, can have a easier time with grocery shopping and even more.
User categories
The typical user for this product will be the average person but will be most likely beneficial for the person responsible for feeding multiple people, a parent and a spouse. Let say there is a mother with multiple kids, and she is responsible for grocery shopping and cooking. To add to the layer of responsibilities we can say that she also works. This app would make it easier for her to keep track of her inventory. This can also be beneficial to someone who lives alone, or homeowners in general.
Features
Input groceries, update usage, grocery list generator.
Persona
	To go into further details about the types of users we will establish personas.
	Parent & Spouse:
		Use case & Scenario: A parent or a spouse wants to get groceries for the week, they input their groceries from last time and every time they used something they finished an item they updated it on the app. When grocery time comes, all they need to do is to click a button to generate grocery list. As they shop, they can check grocery list of items attained.


		User Stories:
	Single Person: 
Use Case & Scenario: A person who lives alone can also make use of this, letâ€™s say that they are very busy, and spend a lot of time out of home.
